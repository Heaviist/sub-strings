# sub-strings
Ruby sub strings project for The Odin Project

# Assignment
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

# Goal
Use array methods to iterate over an array and find matches. This should eventually also work for input consisting of full sentences

# Expectations
- struggle a bit to find the right methods and order of chaining for getting the desired result
- check back in earlier lessons for techniques to achieve this result

# Results and Evaluation
To be added later
